I‚Äôve learned not to let rejection define me, for my identity is firmly set by Christ ‚úùÔ∏è In Him, I find my worth and purpose, and with His strength, I rise above the storms within",

I found solace and transformation in ballet, a discipline that has helped me heal and rediscover myself.

You can bend over backward, do everything they ask, and yet somehow, it never feels like it‚Äôs enough. Despite your best efforts, you may still find that they walk away, leaving you feeling unappreciated and hollow. It's a harsh lesson that no amount of self-sacrifice can guarantee acceptance or love. I've learned that true fulfillment comes from within, and it's essential to prioritize my own well-being and self-worth over trying to please others who may never truly value me",
